I really enjoyed doing the React tutorial. Breaking repeating code into components felt very familiar thanks to
learning object-oriented programming. It was also just really fun to get to follow a tutorial and play around 
in a new environment. React's ability to respond without refreshing the page was really cool. It was a great 
opportunity to practice a lot of the concepts and topics we've seen in class. The JSX language was a bit unfamiliar, 
but it was easy enough to intuit. I've been building a web app in django in another class doing much of the same 
CRUD functionality that the tutorial implemented, so it was really interesting to see the similarities and 
differences between the two frameworks. I also really liked the accessibility section of the tutorial. That is 
something that I haven't had to think much about until now and it's really cool to see how you can implement
functionality in the code to make the app usable by keyboard only and by screen readers. 

The main thing I disliked was just being unfamiliar with the file structure and code structure for React. I made 
a few mistakes and was getting errors when I put some new code in the wrong place, like outside of a function it
should have been inside. Mostly this was just because I didn't understand the syntax well enough to immediately 
recognize when something was in the wrong place. I also had trouble getting a Docker container working, I kept 
getting tons of errors. I'd like to figure out what went wrong as I really didn't like installing everything directly
on my computer since I'm almost out of space already. 

First of all, cats are always entertaining, excuse you. But alright, here, have a limerick.

In the realm where circuits entwine,
A coder sought algorithms divine.
With a keystroke or two,
And a bug or a few,
Their code danced, a symphony of binary rhyme!

And since I incredibly enough have the time for it, have a haiku about chicken broth, the main staple of my diet 
the last week:

Simmering cauldron,
Golden elixir of warmth,
Chicken broth soothes souls.
